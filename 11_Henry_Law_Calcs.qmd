# Calculations

Henry's law is given by

$$
C = kP
$$

where $C$ is the concentration of a dissolved gas, $k$ is Henry's law constant for that gas, and $P$ is the partial pressure of this gas.

Our OM23 incubations were set to 2 atm of pure molecular hydrgoen $H_2$.

```{r}
# Define a Henry's law function
# where P is partial pressure
calculate_conc <- function(k, P) {
  return(k*P)
}
```

Henry's law for H2 in water at 25C is $8.13 \times 10^{-4}$ M\\atm.

```{r}
h2_h_m_atm <- 8.13E-4
h2.M <- calculate_conc(k = h2_h_m_atm, P = 2)

h2_um <- h2.M * 1000
```
